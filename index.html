          "On this day I had to relearn html so that I could make this project, a small step towards productivity and honestly it made me kind of glad that I get to do what I do best but for a good cause rather than a bad one :)",
          "Tuesdays... I had a run planned at 6 and I will try to make it..? I did have wingstop which I know is unhealthy but I'll cancel it out with the run hopefully, I stayed up till 6 in the morning finishing so much homework I'm so relieved, now it's just one class that's left till I'm caught up, we had our final presentation for one of the classes so that's nice, I started looking at jobs within my field, and it all sounds really easy I guess you could say..? Maybe my experience really did pay off at the very least lol but anyways, hopefully the rest of today is productive, no, it will be for sure, but I'll be uploading my hardwork later tonight hopefully, hope you have a really really good day :)... (UPDATE) I ran for 30 minutes, didn't know the trail yet so I didn't bother counting the mile but it's been 3 years and I didn't even vomit at the end of it, this challenge might actually be a.. anything is possible! moment, although the thought of you really gave me that extra boost I needed to keep going, I really do love you so much.",
          "Really early post today, will update again later but I hope you enjoy the pictures I left for you as much as I enjoyed making them :).. I'm posting later than usual but today has been kind of a tougher day than the past two, I went to class and the presentation was super short so I went to the gym to do arms after with my friend but then I went home to clean the apartment and help pack. Everyone's going home for the holidays so I'll take this chance to finish my game, no distractions. I really want to get started on this other one but my progress on this bucket list is taking some time :v.. I do however need to finish my homework first then we'll instantly begin on working towards the game, matter of fact lets go try some black coffee just to get out of my comfort zone, I gave up on the monster drinks because it's time we start thinking about my future rather than just the present me. I'm sorry to myself for not being able to stay completely happy the whole day but yk it be like that sometimes, I want to go on a run but my legs are so sore anyways that's enough for today, I try my best to show love everyday but today I'll be starting on it so maybe a picture but no full project for you just yet sorry, I hope you had a good day today and as always, te amo tantisimo, adios! :) ", 
          "I'm not sure if you even check these or if you ever even got my link but either way I'm still happy to make these for you, anyways good morning beautiful if you see this early, if not good afternoon, I took a while to release this but it kept giving me issues I almost gave up but here we are, hope you have a good day, update later in the day, goodnight, te quiero. Hey, I know I'm really late for today. I want to say it's because I woke up late so I had nothing to really share till now but I was hoping I'd finish my homework tonight and today is a for sure thing I'm like an hour away from finishing it but I don't want to keep you waiting, if you're even here lol, I talked to my mom otp earlier and she asked about you and what I planned on doing with everything that's going on, I told her straight up that, well actually thinking about it is just delusion, I talked to her about a tattoo I want to get, I mean I've always wanted the snake on the forearm but now it seems more realistic to get it, I just hope it doesn't ruin my chances at a dream job but I don't think it will. I'll go tomorrow to ask how much it would be then make a decision the next week, no banita tonight but maybe some bars tomorrow with mishael, and as of today I'm living alone till Sunday and then after that following week I'll be alone for good, I'd be lying if I said this has been an easy week but I'm not here to mope about the sad parts of my day because there's always good ones too, I was iffy on going for a run since my legs were a bit sore but I walked for a bit on a new trail and then started my run and it felt really nice. It's the way that running makes me feel a satisfaction that buying expensive things has never been able to give me, I feel alive, productive, proud. I took a few photos for you, I am however a pretty bad photographer and it's never been my thing to take photos when I'm exploring new things but I like the thought that maybe you're there with me too in a way. I was scared that a snake would be waiting on the trail to bite me but then I said gods plan and kept running it, hopefully we get the chance to do this kind of thing together, it's peaceful and I think you'd appreciate it as much as I did. I hope you enjoy the word search I made you, even if you only play it once, I would push the update into github and then test it on my phone only to realize there was a new bug with every fix I made, I think I got a it working.. at least I hope it works for you but I tried to include things you may relate to, I really wish I got to know you a bit more before this happened but it's okay, I appreciate all of those things about you. It feels a bit lonely here, but I've actually been so busy that I didnt have time to really sit down and look at how my life is, but honestly its for the better because the less thinking I'm doing means the more productivity I'm able to have. I do have thoughts that maybe you'll find someone before I find myself, but I want you to know, or well when you see this, just know that I don't expect you to ever come back, I just hope that a part of you realizes how much your presence really means to me. We're only on day 4 though so I'll try and keep it short for tomorrow, I don't know if you'd enjoy reading this much about someone you're trying to let go of but I just couldn't tell myself I lived life the right way without trying first. Anyways, I'll post earlier tomorrow, I wish I could hear about your day but I'm gonna assume that it's productive and filled with good stories, I hope you're driving safe, I hope you're doing well, and I hope you continue to find happiness in the little things, I love you so much, and I hope you have a goodnight.",
          "What's today, Friday? Hmm I'm feeling a lot better like really good honestly, I completed my assignments and emailed my professors but we're gonna see if they grade those missing assignments but let's hope, it's a lot of weight off my shoulders to be honest and so I'm relieved. I keep getting videos of clubs in Houston from when I would think of places I wanted to take you but now seeing them is just like grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Anyways I woke up pretty late today, like 2PM maybe, which I hate but I'll fix it tonight, I went to the gym at like 5 with mishael then I left to go for my daily run, on average I think my mile might be at 10min rn without me completely trying and whatnot so I think 7 is possible. Uhhh tomorrow I'll be going grocery shopping, only home cooked meals from now on, at least most meals, I'm eating eggs every morning idc I need to get bigger so I can look my age and feel good about it, I hope to one day be able to make you breakfast in bed and see you smile as you eat my 5 star meal which really might be like 3 stars but hopefully your love for me will bump it up by 2 😹, I wonder what you're doing right now, I think you said you don't work on Fridays but if i'm wrong then im sorry but either way I'm sure you're having fun or at least doing something good for yourself, I do miss you though. Ummmm what else.. oh for tonight mishael and I will probably go to banita for dollar well night, he doesn't think there will be a lot of people because everyone went home but honestly I just want to stay productive and out of the house (realistically I just want to take more photos for you to see lol), but yea we'll probably have a few shots but when I tell you I'm being loyal to myself I mean ts, I've never used the I have a gf card before but I will tonight bcs who would I be if not the delusional guy with a love interest who he loves so much he's loyal even if they're not together or wtv, holy yapachino 😹. If you do go out tonight, or this weekend, just do me and yourself a favor and be safe please, it pains me knowing that I can't be there to take care of you myself it really does but I mean you did just fine before me I guess, but idc how much you hate me, if something bad happens, just call me and I'll be there faster than you can count to 10..100,000 but you get the point. I'll update again later tonight because I love being able to just write everything thats on my mind here, I'll drink to our reunion someday, and I want you to know that you'll be on my mind all night, same way you're on it all day, take care princess, I miss you more times than there are stars in this universe. I love you. ",
          "Uh just woke up, will def not be doing that again but so long as I was safe its fine, I was getting really dizzy and close to throwing up last night lol but at least I was home, till I had to drive him home at 4 am lol but I locked in so no worries. I love you, update later, oh and I hope your night went well, whether it was sleep or drinks :)......
